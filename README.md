# Real Time Chat Application
## Objective
Build a real-time chat application using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO.

## Project Description:

In this project, you will create a real-time chat application that allows multiple users to join chat rooms and communicate with each other. The application will be built using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO for real-time communication.

## Project Requirement Description:

1. Set up a basic Node.js project with Express.js, Socket.IO, and other necessary NPM packages.
2. Create a simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to join chat rooms and send messages
3. Implement server-side logic using Node.js and Socket.IO to manage chat rooms, user connections, and message broadcasting.4. Implement the following Socket.IO events on the server-side:
    a. connection: Handle a new user connection.
    b. join: Add a user to a specific chat room.
    c. message: Broadcast a message to all users in a chat room.
    d. disconnect: Handle user disconnections and clean up user data.
5. Implement corresponding Socket.IO event listeners on the client-side using JavaScript to update the user interface in real-time.
6. Implement proper error handling for invalid chat room names, user names, and other potential issues.
7. Test the chat application using multiple browser instances to simulate multiple users.
